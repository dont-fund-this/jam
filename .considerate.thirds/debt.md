when you are able to pay back the things you were given
when you are able to pay back the things you learned
when you are able to provide shelter 
when you are able to provide warmth
when you are able to nurish
[warm-debt]

when you all able, when you can
when you are allowed to ask for a favor
when you have autonomy to do meaningful work
[warm-debt]

when you see that you played a part even unintentionally
when you turn around and see where your impact disrupted
when you turn around and see how disruption was a option

swedes have a saying for pissing yerself to stay warm in the snow
also i learned how ask to rent an octopus wearing dirty underwear
(before any other swedish phrase). it isn't any wierder than ohio
i suspect that paying back your warm debts for warmth is cleaner.
