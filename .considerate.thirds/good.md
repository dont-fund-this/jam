vibe character

you know a person not by their word
but by the weight of their choices 
and the emptiness of their wallet

one is known by his cup and his purse
tested in three things
their cup, their purse, and their anger

[ok-fine-they-werent-actually-my-intern]
[yeah-i-was-the-assistent-to-the-intern]

or 

how one handles intoxication, and
money reveal their true character

[day0]

oh. ok. 
ethics/social contracts
surface-level morality.

cup,    am i a messy drunk?
purse,  am i a pickpocket and/or loser
anger,  working on temper management
in order to maintain social standing, 
so they dont all come for my head. today

[day1]

maybe this is a one of those look again things,
from self-control into integrity under pressure

my cup isnt only traditional intoxication 
closer to how far my inhibition drop 
when i think i am off the clock/offline,
among close friends/family/xmas-party
when i am not in the state country where
i commited to almost anything

are my commitments off the clock in a boat?
what are the implications of 'in a boat'
what are the implications of 'on a train'
what are the implications of 'hop on pop'

did i reveal casual cruelty and prejudice
as the appatizer for a meal, for when the
lights dim, and when curtains are closed?
in what way am i different?

why does the phrase 
  'a proud dutch woman has nothing to hide' 
resonate?

it is related to how things work at home or office
when the village does not see how you are treated?

purse in terms of financial ethics
not just about avoiding theft, but 
how i handle power dynamics related 
to money—fairness with employees,
from generosity and transparency.

in each part of life  
my relationship with 
any sense of wealth.

my anger is my test.

not if. when i do - how quickly
do i use intimidation or blame?

i used anger, my anger used me 
as a tool for my manipulation.

am i consistent in my respect
even when wildly frustrated?

do i have any consistency 
do i have any character
character isn't what i 
present in an interview 

character was, to me, a measure related to my commitment
how many of the things i commited to, to myself & others
how many of them did i finish when it stopped being fun?

but now
is there yet another layer to what i believed for years?

[day2]

anthropological understanding, & character development
fragility and complexity of human nature
everyone struggles, everyone poops.

or 

behaviors that work in a specialized environment, 
can fail to work and in fact become harmful when 
used outside such an environment

so like, maybe check where you are, minfully

is this one of those?

not if i failed/not my recovery 
did i learned anything, at all?
from my that attempt

dont. do. heroin. not. ever. 
it got freddy and it will get you too.
really.  
please?

my cup are my coping mechanisms,
for my stresses, vices, escapes.

words i repeated to myself, both 
my inside and my outsides voices

my purse are the hills i will die on,
when and not if i am forced to choose 
between principle vs profit do i favor 
my self interest with depth vs 
the needs in my village

anger is my window into my vulnerabilities, triggers
do i have moral depth, any self awareness, character

not a tool for judging others, 
my mirror is my reflecetion of 
where growth is most necessary

[day3]

i am the cup
i hold my own hands
i am the purse
i am my anger

[day4]

yet not forever

     verify
then trust,
then rince,
then repeat

while i am able to be the cup i, 
am able to cup my hands with water
today, my cup nurishes your family
today, my cup nurishes my family

today i have autonomy to do 
what matters the most to me

while i am able to be the purse, i
am able to offer all i have to your family
am able to offer all i know to both family

while i am able see that i am my anger
   strive to never fix anything while i am still
  in the same emotional state as when it started
  else i risk everything, for any family near me
