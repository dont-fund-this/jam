you know a person not by their word
but by the weight of their choices 
and the emptiness of their wallet

one is known by his cup and his purse
tested in three things
their cup, their purse, and their anger
[something-an-intern-told-me-that-stuck]

or 

how one handles intoxication, and
money reveal their true character

[part-a]

ethics/social contracts
surface-level morality.

cup,    am i a messy drunk?
purse,  am i a pickpocket and/or loser
anger,  working on temper management
in order to maintain social standing, 
so they dont all come for my head. today

[part-2]

from self-control into
integrity under pressure

people fail these tests in subtle ways

my cup isnt only traditional intoxication 
closer to how far my inhibition drop 
when i think i am off the clock/offline,
among close friends/family/loan officers
when i am not in the state country where
i commited to almost anything

are my commitments off the clock in a boat?
what are the implications of 'in a boat'
what are the implications of 'on a train'
what are the implications of 'hop on pop'

did i reveal casual cruelty and prejudice
as the appatizer for a meal, for when the
lights go down or when curtains are closed, 
in what way am i different?

why is the phrase 
'a proud dutch woman has nothing to hide' 
resonate?

it is related to how things work at home or office
when the village does not see how you are treated?

a purse in terms of financial ethics. 
not just about avoiding theft, but 
about how i handled power dynamics related 
money—fairness with employees, 
generosity & transparency in each part of life  
my relationship with any feeling of wealth 

my anger is my test.
not if, when i do, how quickly,
do i use intimidation or blame?

how i used anger, how my anger used me 
as a tool for manipulation

are you consistent in your respect for us 
even when deeply frustrated

do i have any consistency in my character
character isn't what i present in an interview 

character is, to me, a measure related to my commitments
how many of the things i commited to, to myself & others
how many of them did i finish when it stopped being fun?

[3.]
anthropological, understanding, & character development

the fragility and complexity of human nature
everyone struggles, everyone poops.

dont. do. heroin. not. ever. 
it got freddy and it will get you too.
really.  
please?

not if a i failed, not my recovery 
but did i learned anything, at all
from my attempt

my cup are my coping mechanisms,
for my stresses, vices, escapes.

words i repeated to myself, both 
my inside and my outsides voices

my purse are the hills i will die on, what i truly prioritize 
when and not if i am forced to choose between principle vs profit
do i favor my self interest with depth vs the needs in my village

anger is my window into my vulnerabilities, triggers
do i have moral depth, any self awareness, character

not a tool for judging others, 
my mirror is my reflecetion of 
where growth is most necessary

did you hear about the two firefighters?

spoiler & plot twists,

oooo or the one about almost anything
spoiler & plot twists,  
i am both of them later in that series
so are you
