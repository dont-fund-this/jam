mistakes where made

also, ohno.  
gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
pant pant pant 
gaaaaaaaa
in a theather near you
but your theater man
does not look like mine

heck, and i even named ohio when i started to
where i was born, becasue where are salmon eve going to go 
when salmon me is stressed.  dood.  i swim right back
fast.  as fast as i could, like a fing class 5 
or any thing that i cant spell but looks like 
a fast slurry, any speed, think of the friction. 
my gods the friction of glass moving toward anything i care about
in any speed.  am ok if hmmm i know its like what 40 foot tall
but its only moving 5 things a thing.  i can walk faster than that.
or even a forever highlander slug even.

you nkow what. i used to be surfer adjact i got this
hold my things. i got this, and have seen worse.
im gonna go play with math, be right back

for decades, all of us have.  
im good. you go. something something
[death-by-not-having-ever-seen-walker-fing-cronkite]

if you are in ohio or florida. man, 
that might were you live but you try that in midtown and
um. do that here and, please do not make grandma sad in front of the 
people we treasue and drive for living like a mile from here or coast to coast
if you need a light, ask the guys in the steel mill
also, yeah we roll steel different than you. and if you call us out for that 
online.  and make our grandma sad.  i will feel sad.  in my heart 
that someone posted a pic and made my grandma sad. 

sadness kills grandmas
or moms or maa or what you call the one that cares for you 
and you know what, grandma still goes to church. how come?
becasue believe or not, it is good for everyone.

you know what, 
the kids are sleeping lets sit out on the porch, 
lets not mix things my kids treasure with topics we need to talk about are on tv.
the porch where nearly every child in some way will or might be offered 
if i have the ability, i will offer to them
to practice. just once. hm maybe even twice. 
to help protect those beautiful deer, i mean corn
away from the deer. i am protecting my deer and my corn
bet i know that i need to keep those in balance, i need them both
and i can demonstrate to my commnity that they can still trust me,
to be alowed to be a proud caretaker. right next to them.
and i know this for, a lot of reasons.  a. lot. of. reasons.

so back on the front of my porch, it wraps around the front of, not the back of the house
(
    becasue behind the house i work with dirty things 
    and i dont think you want to watch me hurt myself
    sometimes i fing lose my mind and swear and i say thing
    no child should ever hear, or if they do.  man i hope i was far
    away that they didnt really see me clearly or hear me cleary.
    when really all i want it to be allowed to still be here
    to be allowed to do this.  it is important to me
    this land is REALLY mthefing important to me, 
    no, i dont need any help driving
    ill be right back
)
in clear view, least until the turns for tree, we keep our porch clean
and if we are ever asked, yow know what? you will not need to check.
becasue anyone next to be, that i still feel safe around, will tell you.

and you want to see a butterfly 
smash a giant ship into a canal 
nearly stop christmas..

no stop talking this is making me sad. 
the stuff before i understood.
but you said kids and christmas i must look away

well, if you got here
how about you watch something silly NOT do things that make you or my grandma sad
that can never ever be seen, hopefully i am far away, you didnt actully see me.
you will not need to verify, people will know, and like lighting.  man. 
i hope that was a joke, you know, if the fence on or not or when i try something
that is flip a coin on how my cousin feels, in either a planned way or not.

if i watch two cousins play games with an electric fence that knocks kids down fast
or a garden snake where i got bit.  i pretty glad i got hit by an electric fence 
and i am certain i was bitten in ohio with a cousin on the their land and not if 
i go into a different forest where i wont know a kraat or what that is
a clear sense memory of my cousin tearing the snake of the hard way 
it made like this double horsesshoe pattern.  
with a whole bunch of this little reds dots, 
could not see them at first then i saw more of them and they got either slightly bigger or close
then my counsin thru it round and round into a bush.

i get mixed reactions when i talk about people who slow blinked and watched in thru that

we are all connected
everything is connect
-aang

least harm

lightnig is like, really really fast.  wanna race?

the people that stayed behind were fine by the way.
hope you got this far wanting to hear if this was not like 
that farside cartoon we can not be seen,
becasue, i think the author said in the back of garry larsons books
and he says in the end that it was harder and harder to make them

becasue after a long time he reaslize a picture with no resolution
makes some ones grandma sad. if a child reacted with gaaaaaaa 
then maa was sad.

they are looking at this the same as i was 

also, are you sure you speak english
me.  um.  no.  not always.  
i do see spots, 
i do hear voices,
they are grandmas, not elvis

i have good looking dogs

you read at this point is not based on how i was rasied.

what my dad used a the most vile thing he could say about anything he cared about

i miss chloe
i miss grandpa
i miss dad
i miss pretty much all of you
