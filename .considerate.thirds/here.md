Because all my friends did.
Which scenario is more likely:
Every single person I know, 
many of them levelheaded and afraid of heights, 
abruptly went crazy at exactly the same time...
...or the bridge is on fire?
Imagine reading this on CNN:
"Many fled their vehicles and jumped from the bridge. 
Those who stayed behind..."
Is something good about to happen to those people?
(
  And it says a lot about you (or yermom)
  that when your friends jump off a bridge en masse, 
  your first thought is apparently 
  'my friends are all foolish and I won't be like them' 
  and not 'are my friends ok?'.
)
>> Maybe they'll find cookies?
you stay.
