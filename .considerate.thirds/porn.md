A: its hard to describe. you know it when you see it
Q: is that art or porn?

i think there is at least one more dimension to that venn diagram.
[also-i-have-never-been-awesome-at-those]

the best describtion i heard, it came down to precisely How it was held.
depth and girth i guess is where that went/upset my stomache at the time
but i understood the unsettleing either|or view. 'nestled' was the word.
[the-word-nestled-has-never-been-the-same]

or it is impossible to describe without mentioning 
magic, the divine, aliens, time travel or monsters
[you-know-what-lawrence-would-do-with-one-million-dollars]

i think depth and girth still answers the pron vs art question

if they could flick the tail and shave a house fly
like a some kind of messed up mr scary ass miyagi,
id be looking for answers further than art vs porn
[i-had-something-for-this]

who am i, whoever produced or took the photo or was the model for the magaize that did the cover with the 
model nude except for a bullwhip held in some way out of frame so that it kinda looked like a tail.
