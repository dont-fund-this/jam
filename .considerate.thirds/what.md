A: rapey parts.

what is actually worth working for
what takes all the air outta yer room

  if you dont have enough you think about nothing else.
  if you have enough you never think about it

if it wasnt for money* what would get you outta bed
every day for years as needed, really lean into it.
what would you, not ever really be done practicing.

mix your wants 
with your need 
and risk both.

there are not enough motorcyle accidents
they dont balance the number of hospital
pull that thread, it troubles me. a lot.

i would love to be wrong about this one.
fact check, real hard, tell me i'm wrong
explain it to me slow i was born in ohio

is there a correlastion between shipping containers of live cargo,
and either the price of or number of hospital operations available

when we alledgely put homeless people on busses
the kids we used to go to school with, our pals
who is checking on our pals. that they were not  
..turned into rapey parts for hospital tourism?

when people we don't know are hurded into trucks, 
when we need a tendon, when we need a new eyehole 
we plan that stuff, weeks and weeks out or we fly
does that in any way match accidental deaths?  

i pass a lot of hospitals. 1000s of rooms each.
booked solid, weeks and months or double booked
but i pass dramatically fewer traffic accidents

what are the average numbers of hour where
someone in your family, walked to get water

or what are the average number of hours where
your family walks thru any neighborhood where 
they are hurded into vans by people in masks?

show me evidence they are being harvested
show me evidence they are NOT. your move.

it is amazing water or flint water or.
are there donuts? (that's Not a donut)

which of these things is doing its own thing
which of these things is not like the others
which of these things is profiting on misery

who is watching you leave your house
what did you leave behind, how long?

remember snoops documentary on animal planet,
'ees being watched, theyre plotting right now

how many hours are you the lizard bearing water?
do you have geiko, snakes are strait up assholes
so are the butchers making rapey parts from kids

bet it was not amazing water like not often or ever
guessing the sidewalk was a slick as snot dirt path
broken rocks thru dengue carryig inserts, both ways

there is no way, none, that Chase Bank is involved
i am 1000% certain that Chase Bank is not involved **

there even less chance 300 million and 23 of our pals,
should ever wonder if they are on any rapey parts list

no way, none that anyone at any insurance company you pay
is not also by accident or on purpose exposing your parts
list to people who are very very curious abut your liver.

if there is anything even remotely ironically iteresting here
it's that ohio and also california serial killers scare them.

gozilla vs giant nope nope fuck that nope nope hornets version 

blows my mind

** that it shows, either they are involved & mindful,
maybe chase red spears blue shilds keep its head down
if they are not, then i am dissapointed not surprised.
maybe they wear capes indoors so they dont get sniped.
if you are a bank and not involved, it's not too late.
