A: rapey parts.

what is actually worth working for
what takes all the air outta yer room

  if you dont have enough you think about nothing else.
  if you have enough you never think about it

if it wasnt for money, what would get you outta bed
every day for years as needed, really lean into it.
what would you, not ever really be done practicing.

mix your wants 
with your need 
and risk both.

there are not enough motorcyle accidents
they dont balance the number of hospital
pull that thread, it troubles me. a lot.

i would love to be wrong about this one.
fact check, real hard, tell me i'm wrong
explain it to me slow i was born in ohio

is there a correlastion between shipping containers of live cargo,
and either the price of or number of hospital operations available

when we alledgely put homeless people on busses
the kids we used to go to school with, our pals
who is checking on our pals. that they were not  
..turned into rapey parts for hospital tourism?

when people we don't know are hurded into trucks, 
when we need a tendon, when we need a new eyehole 
we plan that stuff, weeks and weeks out or we fly
does that in any way match accidental deaths?  

i pass a lot of hospitals. 1000s of rooms each.
booked solid, weeks and months or double booked
but i pass dramatically fewer traffic accidents
