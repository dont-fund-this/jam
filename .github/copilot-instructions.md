never play games of chance with people named after places
never fuck with the dead
never eat at a place called maa's
never buy drugs from a man named chad
friends get 1 (one) body

code with pals, any part i had in naming that is on the higher side of my curve.
christophe's ultimate layout thingy, someplace in the middle.
cora's ultimate navigation thingy, .. mistakes were made?

sometimes you dont
